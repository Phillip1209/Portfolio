#INTRODUCTION
Hello, there! ![HelloThereGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78c12568-5ee4-48f4-926b-84fd9c11bf41)

My name is Felipe, and this is my very first encounter with portfolios, well, creating my portfolio. 
I was not sure how to do it so I just did it and here in this place I want to share that side of my learning. Me not fully knowing how to do it but learning by doing it. 
In this first version of my portfolio you will find from my coding-notes (because who said you cannot use python to take notes :p), documentation from my home lab (networking and network security focused), multiple projects which I am really excited to get started, and some other fun stuff.
Plus I want to keep track of my own progress, how my knowledge has evolved and save this "prints" of mine in life. 

TL;DR: Here you will find a collection of my thoughts, projects, notes, and everything else that crosses my mind as "Shareable". It is a reflection of my learning journey and a place where I can come back and be "This is where I started". 

#ABOUT MEðŸ¤ 
As I Mentioned, my name is Felipe, a new adventurer. 
I am nervous, of course but I am happy to share all this. For a while I was lost, I did not really know what to do but then I realized there are many things that ignite something inside of me, and that is helping protect people, helping provide people, helping everyone. As a student of the Tao I know we are all in this together and technology offers many ways to help humanity. I am not looking to change humanity with technology, I am looking to find a better use for technology and the way it serves us. Thats what drives me, my passion for technology and my wish to share my time, energy and love to help many others. I am not inclined with any field for now, but if it comes to using techology to help provide a better life for us all, I am all in. 
This might be a different style of "About me" but hey, this is me. ðŸ˜Š
